# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3484 - [LEARNING LOGS] หุ่นยนต์เคาะเสียงกระเบื้อง
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
677733
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
30-60 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
The problem is to find all problematic tiles and the price to fix them. The tile has five points: center, top-left, ft top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right

Input:
1. Number to indicate the size of the tile n*n and the price to pay per problem. Ex. (6 500)
2-n tile problems for each row. Ex. (0 4 3 0 1 0. Each number represents the number of problems

Output: 
1-n. Tile problems: how many tiles have problems, and how many points. Ex. (0 4 3 0 1 0 3 8)
Three tiles have problems and 8 points to fix
n + 1. Tiles that have problems in a column
n + 2. Points that have problems in a column
n + 3. All tile problems, points, and price to pay (in two decimal places)

Constraints:  (1 ≤ N ≤ 5;0) price can be a float. Max problems for each tile (0 ≤ x ≤ 5) 
```

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
1. Read inputs
2. Count tiles that have problems and append them to a list
3. Sum the problems and append them to a list
4. Use a loop and store the column values in a nested list
5. Then do the same for the column
6. Print the result
```

---

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
The same plan. Read the input, count the tiles, sum the problems, append all tiles for each row to a nested list, do the same for the column, and print the result.
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
Use this sample to understand the problem
```

Input:

```text
6 500
0 4 3 0 1 0
0 5 2 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
5 1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
```

Expected output:

```text
0 4 3 0 1 0 3 8
0 5 2 0 1 0 3 8
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
4 0 0 0 0 0 1 4
5 1 0 1 0 0 3 7
0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2
2 4 2 2 2 0
9 11 5 3 2 0
12 30 15000.00
```

Actual output:

```text
0 4 3 0 1 0 3 8
0 5 2 0 1 0 3 8
0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
4 0 0 0 0 0 1 4
5 1 0 1 0 0 3 7
0 0 0 2 0 0 1 2
