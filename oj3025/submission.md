# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3025 - Season
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
563106
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
30-60 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
The problem wants to know what season it is, according to the month and date

Input: 
Two integers: month and date

Output:
season in string -> "winter"

Constraints:
month is a number between 1 to 12
date is a number between 1 to 31 (ignore the actual date and month correlation in real life) 
```

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
Step 1: Write a season dictionary where the key is season, and the value is a list of months
Step 2: Receives two integers
Step 3: Loop through dictionary
Step 4: Check the condition: if the user's month is in the list, and the date < 21, print the season. Otherwise month%3 = 0 and date >= 21 print the next season  
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
1. Create a dict 2. Read two integers 3. Loop through the dict 4. My logic is wrong and I don't know how to go to the next season, so I change it to this. If the user's month is in the list  and month % 3 not = to 0 or date < 21 print season and break. Otherwise  the user's month is in the list  and month % 3 = to 0 and date >= 21, declare a season key, and loop through season key if current key = season key print the next season and break. 
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
Print a season according to a month
```

Input:

```text
1
1
```

Expected output:

```text
winter
```

Actual output:

```text
winter
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2

Why I chose this case:

```text
The month is divisible by 3, and the date is 21
```

Input:

```text
3
21
```

Expected output:

```text
spring
```

Actual output:

```text
spring
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 3

Why I chose this case:

```text
The last season of the list, and the date is > than 21
```

Input:

```text
12
22
```

Expected output:

```text
winter
```

Actual output:

```text
winter
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

## 6. AI Use

Did you use AI for this problem?

```text
No
```

If yes, also complete:

```text
ai_reflection.md
```

If you only asked a friend, TA, or instructor and did not use AI, you do not need to complete `ai_reflection.md`.
