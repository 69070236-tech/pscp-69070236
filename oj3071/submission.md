# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3071 - จำนวนในช่วง [A,B] ที่หารด้วย d เหลือเศษ r
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
576446
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
0-15 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
The problem wants me to find the range of numbers that are divisible by d and have a remainder of r

Input:
4 integers
a = the start number
b = the end number
d = divisor
r = remainder

Output: total number of numbers in the range

Constraints: a < b and d not equal to 0
```

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
1. Take four integers in order
2. Create a list to store all numbers that meet the condition
3. Try to modulo a by d; if the remainder is r, append a to the list, and then keep adding d to a and modulo until a is greater than or equal to b
4. If a modulo by d and the remainder is not r, then add 1 to a and try again until it corrects
5. Print the length of the list
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
As I plan. Take 4 inputs, create a list, use while loop to execute a % d, if a % d and the remainder is r, append a to the list, add d to a and repeat the loop. If a % d and the remainder is not r, add 1 to a, and repeat the loop. Finally, print the length of the list.
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
A modulo d is equal to r
```

Input:

```text
10
20
3
1
```

Expected output:

```text
4
```

Actual output:

```text
4
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2

Why I chose this case:

```text
A modulo d is not equal to r
```

Input:

```text
30
100
5
2
```

Expected output:

```text
14
```

Actual output:

```text
14
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 3

Why I chose this case:

```text
Big number
```

Input:

```text
1000
10000
99
98
```

Expected output:

```text
91
```

Actual output:

```text
91
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

## 6. AI Use

Did you use AI for this problem?

```text
No
```

If yes, also complete:

```text
ai_reflection.md
```

If you only asked a friend, TA, or instructor and did not use AI, you do not need to complete `ai_reflection.md`.
